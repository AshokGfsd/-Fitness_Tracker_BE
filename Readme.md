Absolutely, Ashok! Exercise is essential for overall health and weight gain. Focus on strength training exercises to build muscle mass. Here are some effective workouts:

Start with lighter weights and progress gradually. Aim for 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps for each exercise. Incorporate exercises that target multiple muscle groups at once, like deadlifts and bench press.

Remember to:

- Consult a fitness professional or doctor to create a personalized workout plan.
- Warm up before each session and cool down afterwards.
- Rest and recover adequately between workouts.

Combine strength training with a balanced diet, and you'll be on your way to healthy weight gain!

Setting daily goals for users based on their BMI category can be a great way to help them achieve a healthy weight. Here are some general guidelines for daily calorie intake:

Underweight (BMI < 18.5)

Normal weight (BMI = 18.5-24.9)

Keep in mind that these are general guidelines and may vary depending on individual factors such as age, gender, height, and activity level. It's always best to consult a healthcare professional or registered dietitian for personalized recommendations.

In your app, you can use these guidelines to set daily calorie goals for users based on their BMI category. Also, consider providing a macronutrient breakdown (carbs, protein, fat) and a meal plan or food diary to help users achieve their goals.
